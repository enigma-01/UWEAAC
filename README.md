# University of Waterloo Engineering Admission Chance Calculator

## About
UWEACC is a tool used to (very poorly) approximate one's chances of admission into Waterloo Engineering. Utilizing data from [Waterloo's Highschool Adjustment Factor List](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/), it calculates your chance of admission incorporating all factors of the Waterloo Engineering admission process (AIF Score, Interview Score, Top 6 Marks, Program of Choice, and whether or not you're in IB). 

The chances for admission are calculated by functions modelled after [the ones](https://theroadtoengineering.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/admission-chances.png) provided in [this](https://theroadtoengineering.com/2018/09/06/chances-of-admission-for-fall-2019/) blog post written by William Bishop. 

The calculated admission chance is not to be taken seriously, and is not representitative of the University of Waterloo's admissions process.
