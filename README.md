# University of Waterloo Engineering Admission Chance Calculator

## About
UWEACC is a tool used to (very poorly) approximate one's chances of admission into Waterloo Engineering. Utilizing data from [Waterloo's Highschool Adjustment Factor List](https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/), it calculates your chance of admission incorporating all factors of the Waterloo Engineering admission process (AIF, Interview, Marks, Program of Choice, and whether or not you're in IB). The chances for admission are calculated by functions modelled after the ones provided in [this](https://theroadtoengineering.com/2018/09/06/chances-of-admission-for-fall-2019/) blog post written by William Bishop.
